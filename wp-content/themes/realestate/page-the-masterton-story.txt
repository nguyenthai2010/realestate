Truthfully,&nbsp;Jim's also pretty well known around the other states of Australia too, which isn't surprising when you've spent over&nbsp;fifty years of your life in the same industry, and can boast&nbsp;to have built 50,000 new homes for Australian families&nbsp;over that time.<br>
                                <br>
                                Ask anyone at Masterton how&nbsp;"<strong>Jim's Way</strong>"&nbsp;influences the&nbsp;work we do and the way we look after our customers, and they'll tell you that even&nbsp;in his early&nbsp;80's, Jim still plays a very active and valuable part in our company.<br>
                                <br>
                                Masterton Homes has now been part of the NSW home building community for&nbsp;half a century. Jim's legacy will live on for decades to come, through generations of the Masterton family now actively involved in the business - and through the values he instilled in all of us over the years.<br>
                                <br>
                                There will always be "Jim's Way", and we'll always respect and honour the lessons Jim taught us.<br>
